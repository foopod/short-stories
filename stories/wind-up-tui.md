A whining sound sliced through the chatter of the birds submerged in the green. I sighed. Another one to fix, I thought to myself as I trudged deeper into the forest. My boots crunching along. Following this lonely droning sound in the forest, I eventually came across the culprit. It was jammed. Damn. I picked up the bird and turned it in my hand. The mechanism in the back whirling as it tried to turn and turn and turn. A quick flick of my screwdriver got it revolving again and I carefully set him back up in his tree. Unclenching his feet, I curled them around the branch and gave his gleaming feathers, inky blacks and iridescent blues, a pat as he released his artificial warble to the growing song around him. 

A child once asked me, what were the real birds like. The ones that were not cold steel, with jerking movements and glassy dead eyes. I remembered staring at his upturned face. Alive. I replied. Tasting the word as it left my mouth. 

The world had been long since burned and warped and razed through humanity's unyielding grip on greed and power. 

Seas had lapped up coastlines like milk, evaporating their edges. Multi-millionaire dollar homes crumbled like cookies into the dark sea below. An insatiable sea, always hungry. It made for great television, watching these millionaires sob on screen. In front of their soggy homes. 

Animals had gone extinct. One after another. Bees to bears. All fading until they were simply ink in our history books. 

Climate change. What a bitch. I smiled without humour, as I followed another whining whirring sound through the forest. Another one to fix. Going to be a busy day.
