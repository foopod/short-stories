title: Sides of a Sphere
---

He checked his wrist again. The numbers still counting down. 60.

At his feet was a black bag, into it he put his hand and out he pulled a golden orb the size of an apple. It's surface was dull and had strange patterns embedded on the outside, almost like there were thousands of tiny wires running across the surface. Each wire ran its own path, made connections to others and then eventually ran to the top of the sphere where they all joined to form a ring. 48.

He looked down at his wrist again and then at the golden orb. 36.

Placing his thumb firmly on the ring at the top of the orb, he breathed deeply. 25.

The looming concrete walls of the now empty carpark building surrounded him. It was a busy city and hard to get away from people. But right now he was entirely alone. Not a soul in his proximity, no one on his mind. 23.

After taking a final glance at the time, 18, he depressed the top of the orb with a satisfying click. 16.

Nothing happened. 10.

It started as a low hum, but started growing higher in pitched quickly. The orb shimmered in the mans hand, almost flashing like lightning as the concrete and ashphalt lit up around him. 6.

His coat was swaying in the breeze. A second later gusts around him were pulling at the rest of his clothes. 3.

The flashing now getting brighter. 2.

The sound now deafening. 1.

And with a loud crack it all stopped. The man was just left there standing.

He checked his wrist again. The numbers still counting down. 60.
