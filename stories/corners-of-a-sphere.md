title: The Corners of a Sphere
---

He stood still, checking his wrist again. The numbers still counting down. 60 seconds.

The lights flickered in the dark parking garage. The lot was scarce, just a few cars, dumpsters and roller doors. Flourescent lights overhead that barely lit the ground directly below them. 

The man wore a weathered face and his eyes hung low, deep set in their sockets. The coat on his back was worn around the shoulders and elbows. If he wasn't standing in the very center of the building with a black bag at his feet he would have melted into the background. You wouldn't have taken a second look.

He leaned down and tucked his hand into the bag. It quickly emerged with a glisten. The man's lean fingers wrapped around a lustrous golden orb. It looked a bit odd in the man's presence, like a homeless woman carrying a posh purse. Its surface was dimpled with strange patterns spiralling around it. Hundreds of tiny wires ran across it. Each taking its own path, making connections to others and then eventually running to the top of the sphere where they all joined to form a ring. 48.

The man stood firm. His eyes fixed on the orb. Somehow he was both sure and unsure. The feeling he felt in his fingertips was instinctual, yet hesitant. 

"How much more?" he wondered. 

He knew the answer. 

But dreaded to accept it.

He looked down at his wrist again, then back to the golden sphere. 36.

"One more time" he whispered to himself. He slowly closed his eyes and let out a deep breath. The warm air dissipating into the cold night.

He placed his thumb firmly on the ring at the top of the orb. 25.

The looming concrete walls of the carpark stood tall around him. During the day the city was busy and hard to escape the other inhabitants. But right now this man was entirely alone. Not a soul in his proximity. Eeerily quiet. 23.

But someone was on his mind. A time ago he had to leave his son behind. At this point he wasn't even sure how long it had been. 

"Was it weeks? Maybe months?" he asked himself. It certainly felt like an eternity. 19.

He recalled his own first year at university. He hoped that Oliver had made some friends. He hoped that he wouldn't struggle with the workload. He hoped that he would have someone to lean on when he needed it. He hoped that this person would stand by his side and support his son when he couldn't.

He hoped, because, now, that was all he could do. He hoped that his son wouldn't get caught in the same trap that his father did. A trap that had stripped him of almost all that he held dear. The only solace was knowing that every second he spent here was another that people like Oliver would have to spend with the ones they loved. 17.

He took another glance at the watch. It was as utilitarian as watches are made. Heavy plastic. Digital. With a large screen. Scratches and scuffs made their way into the bezel, but physical damage did not impact the legibility of the digits. 15.

He depressed the top of the orb with a satisfying click. 14.

Silence followed. Total silence. 13.

Nothing happened. If the lights flickered, it was a coincidence. 12.

Then a low hum started, slowly growing into a deep rumble. The orb shimmered in the mans hand. Over time growing in brightness, soon it became like lightning, the ashphalt lighting up around him. 6.

His coat moved in the breeze that wasn't there a second ago. One more second later and gusts around him were pulling at his body, his sleeves trembling in the gale. 3.

The bright orb now illuminated the whole carpark, casting harsh shadows onto the rough grey walls. 2.

The sound now deafening. The rumbling now growing in pitch. 1.

And with a loud crack it all stopped. The man was left there standing still in an empty parking garage. The orb in his hand no longer glowed, but shimmered slightly in his hand. He knelt. Unzipped the bag. And gently placed the orb inside.

He stood still, checking his wrist again. The numbers still counting down. 60 seconds.
